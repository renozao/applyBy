Description: This package defines a function applyBy that enables applying a
    function along margins of matrix-like objects separately within groups of
    columns/rows defined by factor(s), e.g., computing aggregated summary
    statistics. It is essentially a wrapper around functions from the the
    matrixStats package, which provide very fast alternative implementation to
    the base aggregate function.
